Hypothesis: Singapore is a good place to live or work in. 

## Target Users 
Our group decided on a stakeholder group comprised of Singaporean graduates aged 16 to 21, holding either an O Level certificate, Diploma, or both. 

## Purpose
Through this project, we broke down the hypothesis into different factors and unraveled this statement by analyzing its different elements, then united them to produce a complete answer.  
Based on our stakeholderâ€™s interview, we learned that many are unsure of Singapore's suitability as a place to live or work in. While many of them have slight dissatisfaction and unhappiness with their quality of life, they are also satisfied with what they have. Hence, we have created the following visuals in response to our stakeholders' desire for overall affordability of all factors, accessibility to goods and services, subsidies, high-quality services, frequency of services, more and equal opportunities, and smooth transportation.

## Factors
- Transportation
- Security
- Consumer Goods 
- Education 
- Healthcare
- Recreation 
- Economy

## Conclusion
In conclusion, all the factors mentioned show that Singapore is doing its best in making Singapore a better place to live in, such as the efforts they have put in to ensure smoother public transportation and a safer environment for citizens. In addition, they also put much effort into reducing the price of local goods and ensuring quality education is open to all citizens. Also, with the many facilities provided and increased spending each year, Singapore has proved to have put much effort into ensuring high-quality healthcare. Furthermore, they provide many job opportunities to aid citizens with retrenchment. Lastly, Singapore has been ensuring affordability and accessibility for all citizens in Singapore regardless of the factor. 
Thus, we feel that the stakeholders should appreciate what they have and open their minds to issues such as criminal cases, affordability, and accessibility so they will be up-to-date with Singapore's efforts in improving our quality of life. Therefore learning how to work around and manage different problems.
